    Robert Valliciergo
I am an Information Management and Technology major with a concentration in information security. I hope to join the cyber security field. I can fluently speak Spanish and am a proud member of KTP and the Orientation Leader team. Outside of my professional life, I enjoy listening to music, watching sports, and playing guitar hero.
