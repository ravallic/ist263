                <p>The infield fly rule in baseball is designed to prevent unfair double plays or triple plays on easily catchable pop-ups in the infield. It applies when there are fewer than two outs and runners on first and second, or the bases are loaded. If a batter hits a pop-up that an infielder can catch with ordinary effort, the umpire declares an "infield fly," and the batter is automatically out, regardless of whether the ball is caught. This rule allows base runners to remain safely on their bases without risking a force out. The infield fly rule ensures fair play by preventing the defense from intentionally letting the ball drop to create an easy double or triple play.</p>

                <p>A balk in baseball is an illegal motion or action by the pitcher that deceives the runner, allowing all runners on base to advance one base. Common examples include starting a pitching motion but failing to deliver the ball, making an illegal pickoff move, or failing to come to a complete stop in the set position. To avoid balks, pitchers should focus on maintaining consistent mechanics, practicing proper pickoff techniques, and being aware of the rules governing their actions. On the other hand, base runners can try to draw a balk by using aggressive leads or movement to pressure the pitcher into making a mistake. Understanding the nuances of balk rules can help pitchers stay in control and base runners gain an advantage.</p>

                <p>A hit by pitch (HBP) occurs when a batter is struck by a pitched ball and awarded first base, provided they made an effort to avoid the pitch and were not swinging. For batters, this rule can be advantageous, as it allows them to reach base without needing a hit. Some batters strategically crowd the plate to increase their chances of being hit, especially in critical game situations where getting on base is key. For pitchers, hitting a batter is something to avoid, as it gives the opposing team a free base runner and can shift momentum. To prevent HBPs, pitchers should focus on maintaining control, avoiding wild pitches, and being cautious when pitching inside. Balancing an aggressive pitching strategy with accuracy is crucial to minimizing these costly mistakes.</p>
