                <p>Bunting in baseball is a strategic technique where the batter lightly taps the ball to advance base runners or create offensive opportunities. It is often used for sacrifice bunts to move runners into scoring position, bunts for hits to take advantage of defensive positioning, or squeeze plays to score a runner from third base. Bunting puts pressure on the defense, increasing the likelihood of errors or misplays, and can disrupt defensive shifts. Key to successful bunting are proper stance, bat angle to keep the ball on the ground, and precise placement to exploit gaps in the infield. Though not as flashy as a big hit, bunting can shift momentum and play a crucial role in a team’s offensive strategy.</p>

                <p>A sacrifice fly in baseball occurs when a batter hits a fly ball deep enough into the outfield to allow a runner on third base to tag up and score after the ball is caught. Though the batter is credited with an out, they also receive an RBI (run batted in) for driving in the run. Sacrifice flies are most effective with less than two outs, as they rely on the runner having time to advance before the play is completed. This strategy is particularly valuable in close games, as it prioritizes scoring runs over the batter’s personal statistics. Sacrifice flies demonstrate the importance of situational hitting and are a key tool for creating runs without needing a base hit.</p>

                    <p>Avoiding a double play as a batter is a critical skill in baseball, especially with runners on base and less than two outs. A double play typically occurs when the batter hits a ground ball that allows the defense to record two outs in one play. To prevent this, batters focus on situational hitting, such as aiming for fly balls, line drives, or ground balls to specific areas of the field where turning a double play is more difficult. Speed is also a factor; hustling to first base can sometimes beat out the throw and keep the inning alive. Proper pitch selection and avoiding weak contact, like grounders to the middle infield, are key to minimizing double play risks and maximizing offensive opportunities.</p>
